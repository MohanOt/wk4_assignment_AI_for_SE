=== Task 4: AI Code Optimization Results ===
Run timestamp: 2025-11-01 01:27:32.998487


AI Suggestion:
Instead of iterating manually through the list to compute a sum,
use NumPy's vectorized operations which are optimized in C.
Optimized version:
    def efficient_sum(numbers):
        return np.sum(numbers)

=== Performance Comparison ===
Inefficient Loop: 4.1649 seconds
Efficient NumPy: 0.0170 seconds
Speed Improvement: 244.75x faster
